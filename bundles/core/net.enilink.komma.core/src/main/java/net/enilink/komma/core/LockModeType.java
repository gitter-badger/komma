/**
 * Six lock mode types are defined: OPTIMISTIC, OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT,
 * PESSIMISTIC_READ, PESSIMISTIC_WRITE, PESSIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT, NONE. The
 * lock mode type values READ and WRITE are synonyms of OPTIMISTIC and
 * OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT respectively. The latter are to be preferred for
 * new applications.
 * <p>
 * Lock modes <b>OPTIMISTIC</b> and <b>OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT</b> are used
 * for optimistic locking. The semantics of requesting locks of type
 * LockModeType.OPTIMISTIC and LockMode- Type.OPTIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT are the
 * following.
 * <p>
 * If transaction T1 calls lock(entity, LockModeType.OPTIMISTIC) on a versioned
 * object, the entity manager must ensure that neither of the following
 * phenomena can occur:
 * <ul>
 * <li>P1 (Dirty read): Transaction T1 modifies a row. Another transaction T2
 * then reads that row and obtains the modified value, before T1 has committed
 * or rolled back. Transaction T2 eventually commits successfully; it does not
 * matter whether T1 commits or rolls back and whether it does so before or
 * after T2 commits.
 * <li>P2 (Non-repeatable read): Transaction T1 reads a row. Another transaction
 * T2 then modifies or deletes that row, before T1 has committed. Both
 * transactions eventually commit successfully.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Lock modes <b>PESSIMISTIC_READ</b>, <b>PESSIMISTIC_WRITE</b>, and
 * <b>PESSIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT</b> are used to immediately obtain long-term
 * database locks. The semantics of requesting locks of type
 * LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ, LockMode- Type.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE, and
 * LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_FORCE_INCREMENT are the following.
 * <p>
 * If transaction T1 calls lock(entity, LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_READ) or
 * lock(entity, LockModeType.PESSIMISTIC_WRITE)on an object, the entity manager
 * must ensure that neither of the following phenomena can occur:
 * <ul>
 * <li>P1 (Dirty read): Transaction T1 modifies a row. Another transaction T2
 * then reads that row and obtains the modified value, before T1 has committed
 * or rolled back.
 * <li>P2 (Non-repeatable read): Transaction T1 reads a row. Another transaction
 * T2 then modifies or deletes that row, before T1 has committed or rolled back.
 * </ul>
 * Any such lock must be obtained immediately and retained until transaction T1
 * completes (commits or rolls back).
