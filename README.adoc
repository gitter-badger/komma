= KOMMA

This is the main repository for the KOMMA project.

KOMMA (Knowledge Modeling and Management Architecture) is an adaptable framework for the management and editing of RDF, RDFS and OWL. 
It provides Object-Triple-Mapping (comparable to JPA), an Editing framework as well as
Eclipse RCP and RAP integration. In short: KOMMA is for RDF+OWL what the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) is
for ECore/MOF.
